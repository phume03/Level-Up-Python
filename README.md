# Python Challenges (Level Up) #

## Level Up Python by LinkdedIn Learning ##

A part of this repository contains my solutions to the challenges presented in the [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) course [Level Up: Python](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/level-up-python/). They are as follows: 

1. Prime Factors: produce the prime factorization of a given number

2. Palindrome: determine if a given string/phrase/sentence is a palindrome

3. Sort String: alphabetically sort the words in a given phrase/sentence (ignoring case)

4. Find All List Items: find all the indices (indexes) of a given word/item in a list. Include nested references to the word in the sublists of the initial list

5. Play the Waiting Game: use python time to determine if a user playing a game follows a simple instruction or game prompt to wait a random number of seconds between two to four seconds.

6. Save a Dictionary

7. Schedule a Function

8. Send an Email

9. Simulate Dice

10. Count Unique Words

11. Generate a Password

12. Merge CSV Files

13. Solve a Sudoku

14. Build a Zip Archive

15. Download Sequential Files

## Matthew Whiteside's Python Programming Puzzles ##

The other part contains solutions to a collection of puzzles curated by [MatWhiteside](https://github.com/MatWhiteside/python-puzzle-book/). The code here was not cloned from Whiteside\'s repo but you can visit that repo to get skeleton/scaffold code and solutions to the puzzles as presented in the book. This code was created using python3.x (>3.12), and VSCode.

### Challenge Puzzles ###

1. Filter Strings: filter a list of strings by strings containing the letter "a". Parametrized tested.

2. Sum Under 50: sum up two integers if their total is less than 50. Parameterized tested for illegal inputs/negative test cases, and edge cases. 

3. Sum Even:

50+ puzzles


### Fun Puzzles ###




## Others ##

1. String Punctuation: defines functions that take in an input string and return true if the string contains a punctuation, and false if it doesn't.

2. Running Averages: defines functions that take in an (x,y) data set and produce an (x,y,y1) tuple, where y1 is the running average of y.


## Requirements ##

For these modules to work, you will need to have [Python](https://www.python.org) >= 3.12. Then you need to install the pytest library. You can do this by using `pip`, and you can run it in a Python virtual environment so as not to affect your system files (especially if your system will be using a lower version of python in general):

```console
$ python -m venv devenv
$ source devenv/bin/activate
$ python -m pip install pytest
```

You really can run the examples without pytest, but you will need it to run the automated test cases.

## How to Run Examples ##

To run scripts or modules from your system's command line or terminal, execute the following command:

```console
$ python <script-name>.py
```

Run this from the project directory and it will automatically pick pycalc to install in editable mode.
